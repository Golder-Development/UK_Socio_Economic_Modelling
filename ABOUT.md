# About this project

This repository exists to support a particular way of thinking about
UK socio-economic systems.

It is not a single model, a single argument, or a single conclusion.
It is a workspace for exploring how systems evolve, interact, and
sometimes fail — often without anyone explicitly intending them to.

The code, charts, and dashboards here are tools in that process,
not the point of it.

## Why this exists

Many public discussions about policy focus on:
- individual decisions,
- moral intent,
- or isolated moments in time.

This project starts from a different place.

It assumes that most large-scale outcomes are shaped by:
- incentives,
- institutional structure,
- feedback loops,
- and accumulated complexity.

Over time, systems tend not to be redesigned cleanly.
They accrete.
They layer.
They adapt around previous compromises.

The goal here is to make those dynamics more visible.

## What kind of project this is

This is deliberately a **hybrid space**:

- part analytical modelling,
- part exploratory data work,
- part visual explanation,
- part public-facing thinking.

Some elements are stable.
Some are experimental.
Some exist mainly to help reason through a question, rather than to
produce a final answer.

That is intentional.

Clarity is prioritised over false precision.
Understanding is prioritised over persuasion.

## How this connects to the writing

Many of the ideas explored here are written up in a more narrative,
conversational form on the accompanying blog:

https://hysnapsmusicandmentalhealth.wordpress.com/

The blog and this repository are complementary:

- the blog focuses on explanation and framing,
- the repository contains the underlying models, data, and visuals.

Charts published via GitHub Pages often correspond directly to posts,
and posts often link back to code and data here.

## What this is not

This project is not:
- a party-political platform,
- a campaign site,
- or a claim to definitive answers.

Disagreement is expected.
Revision is normal.
Changing one’s mind in response to evidence is a feature, not a flaw.

## For collaborators

If you’re reading this because you’re considering contributing:

- curiosity matters more than certainty,
- explaining your assumptions matters more than being “right”,
- and understanding system behaviour matters more than winning arguments.

If something feels unclear or under-specified, that’s often a sign
that it’s worth discussing rather than fixing silently.

Opening issues for conversation is encouraged.

## A final note

This project sits at the boundary between
analysis, explanation, and public conversation.

If you’re here to explore how complex systems behave —
and how well-intended decisions can still lead to familiar outcomes —
you’re in the right place.
