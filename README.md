# UK Socio-Economic Modelling

**A living repository for modelling, visualising, and exploring UK socio-economic systems — with an emphasis on structure, incentives, and unintended outcomes.**

This project brings together multiple analytical models, data pipelines, and visual outputs designed to help explore how UK socio-economic systems behave over time — and how policy decisions, incentives, and institutional design interact in practice.

👉 **GitHub Pages is active for this repository**, allowing selected generated outputs (charts and figures) to be viewed directly in a browser without running the code locally.

For background on the intent, philosophy, and how to read this project, see [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md).

A short, non-technical introduction to the charts published from this project is available on the GitHub Pages site: <https://golder-development.github.io/UK_Socio_Economic_Modelling/>

## 🌍 What this project is (and isn’t)

This repository is **not** a single finished model, paper, or dashboard.

Instead, it is:

* a **modular modelling workspace**,
* a **shared codebase** for socio-economic analysis,
* and a bridge between **technical analysis and public explanation**.

Across the project, the recurring questions are things like:

* *How do systems accrete complexity over time?*
* *What happens when incentives are misaligned — even without bad intent?*
* *Why do policy outcomes often feel familiar, cyclical, or inevitable?*
* *What does the data actually say once we step away from moral framing?*

The aim is not to “win” arguments, but to **make systems legible**.

## 🌐 GitHub Pages (Live Outputs)

This repository has **GitHub Pages enabled** to host **static outputs generated by the models**.

🔗 **Live site:**
[https://golder-development.github.io/UK_Socio_Economic_Modelling/](https://golder-development.github.io/UK_Socio_Economic_Modelling/)

### What’s published there

* Charts and figures generated into `generated_charts/`
* Static outputs intended for:

  * review and discussion
  * blog posts and written analysis
  * stakeholder or collaborator inspection

### Why this exists

GitHub Pages is used deliberately as a **lightweight publishing layer**:

* Outputs can be viewed without cloning the repo
* Results can be discussed independently of execution
* Visuals can be referenced while models continue to evolve

> Interactive dashboards live elsewhere (`apps/`). Pages exists to make *outputs visible*, not to replace exploration tools.

## ✍️ Related Writing & Context

Many of the ideas explored in this repository are written up — in a more conversational, narrative form — on the accompanying blog:

🔗 **Hysnaps: Music and Mental Health (with a bit of politics and systems thinking)**
[https://hysnapsmusicandmentalhealth.wordpress.com/](https://hysnapsmusicandmentalhealth.wordpress.com/)

The blog posts:

* provide context and motivation for the models,
* walk through results in plain English,
* and explore the *“why does this keep happening?”* side of the data.

If you’re coming to this repository from a post, you’ll often find:

* the underlying data,
* the code that generated the charts,
* and related exploratory work here.

## 🧠 Design philosophy

Several principles recur across the project:

### 1. Systems over events

The focus is on **structures, feedback loops, and incentives**, not just individual decisions or moments in time.

### 2. Accretion, not replacement

New systems tend to **layer on top of old ones**, rather than replacing them cleanly. Models reflect this wherever possible.

### 3. Unintended outcomes matter

Many harmful outcomes arise without malice — through complexity, delegation, and partial understanding.

### 4. Iterative and exploratory

This is a **working repository**. Some models are stable, others are deliberately incomplete or exploratory.

Clarity beats false certainty.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Dashboards & Exploration

Interactive dashboards live in **apps/** (typically Streamlit-based):

```bash
cd apps
streamlit run main_app.py
```

Dashboards are used where interaction adds value and where readers benefit from being able to *play with the system* rather than just read about it.

---

## 📊 Modelling & Outputs

Typical workflow:

1. Data ingestion or enrichment in `data_sources/`
2. Analysis via scripts or notebooks in `models/` / `notebooks/`
3. Visual outputs written to `generated_charts/`
4. Selected outputs committed for visibility via GitHub Pages

This separation allows:

* reproducible modelling,
* visible artefacts,
* and discussion without requiring execution.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaboration & contribution

Contributions are welcome, particularly around:

* extending or refining models,
* adding data sources or adapters,
* improving visual clarity,
* documentation and explanation.

If you’re unsure whether something fits, opening an **Issue** for discussion first is encouraged.

---

## 🛠️ Development Demarcation

To keep the repository clean and reproducible, there is a clear separation between the tracked regeneration pipeline and a local-only sandbox:

* Tracked pipeline: essential scripts in [data_sources/mortality_stats/development_code](data_sources/mortality_stats/development_code) regenerate data and dashboards from a clean clone.
* Local sandbox: helpers and ad-hoc tools live under [local_dev/tools](local_dev/tools) and are ignored by Git.

See the detailed guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what belongs where, how to run the pipeline, and commit hygiene.

## 💬 Discussion

If you’re interested in:

* collaborating on modelling,
* reusing components,
* or discussing the wider systems approach,

please open an **Issue** or **Discussion** on GitHub.

This project deliberately sits at the boundary between
**analysis, explanation, and public conversation**.
