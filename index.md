# About this site

This site hosts **charts and visual outputs** generated from the
UK Socio-Economic Modelling project.

They are part of an ongoing attempt to make complex social,
economic, and political systems more legible — not to provide
definitive answers or forecasts.

## What you’re looking at

The charts published here are generated directly from analytical
models and exploratory data work.

They are intended to:
- illustrate patterns and trends,
- highlight structural dynamics,
- and support discussion rather than close it down.

Some charts relate directly to published blog posts.
Others exist to explore a question or test an idea.

## What this isn’t

These visuals are **not**:
- official statistics,
- policy recommendations,
- or finished research outputs.

They are working artefacts from an evolving project.

Uncertainty, revision, and iteration are part of the process.

## A note on interpretation

Complex systems rarely behave neatly.
Patterns often emerge without clear intent.
Outcomes can feel familiar even when the context changes.

These charts are an invitation to think about *why that might be*.

If something raises questions rather than answers — that’s usually
the point.
